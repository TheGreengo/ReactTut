# Skool Me
Just to learn React and Django a little bit, I'm going to make a fake little student portal applet thing. The current plan is to make the frontend in React and backend in Django seperately first and then smoosh them together and then maybe polish the whole thing off but we'll see lolz.

Current Todos:
1. make the study view work
  1.3 shows one card at a time
  1.4 clicks between front vs. back
    - 1.4.1 animation of flipping
2. make everything prettier

# Plan
- flashcards
    - and clicking on the card will swap the side
    - learn how to make a fancy flipping animation
- assignments
    - there should be submissions and quizes
    - I'm not sure if there should be a middle thing or side thing
    - quizes should have a start page
    - and then following pages with multiple pages or response sections
    - or even submissions
    - then they should finish with a submit thing
    - submission pages should have a description, then a submission part
    - after submissions 
- lessons
    - the lessons should just be a page with 
    - special fields
    - or pictures
    - and subheadings
    - the sidebar should have a little dropdown for the current lesson
    - with hyperlinks that scroll down to the subheading/image of choice
