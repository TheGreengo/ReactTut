# SkoolMe
Just to learn React a little bit, I'm going to make a fake little student portal applet thing. 

3. make it so that you can add or remove cards
4. make it so that you can delete cards
5. make it so that you can favorite cards
  5.1 add that whole favorited thing as a field
6. make the study view work
  6.1 starts with asking in order or shuffled
  6.2 then (if desired) randomizes
  6.3 shows one card at a time
  6.4 clicks between front vs. back
    - 6.4.1 animation of flipping
7. make last studied update when back is seen
8. make everything prettier
9. make it so that you can add decks
10. make it so that you can delete decks
# Plan
- flashcards
    - clicking on a deck in the left bar should display the cards in the deck on the right
    - with a button on the top to study
    - each card should show the front and back
    - and have a checkbox to be included
    - when you click to study, it will have side to side arrows
    - and clicking on the card will swap the side
    - learn how to make a fancy flipping animation
- assignments
    - there should be submissions and quizes
    - I'm not sure if there should be a middle thing or side thing
    - quizes should have a start page
    - and then following pages with multiple pages or response sections
    - or even submissions
    - then they should finish with a submit thing
    - submission pages should have a description, then a submission part
    - after submissions 
- lessons
    - the lessons should just be a page with 
    - special fields
    - or pictures
    - and subheadings
    - the sidebar should have a little dropdown for the current lesson
    - with hyperlinks that scroll down to the subheading/image of choice
