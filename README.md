# ReactTut
Just to learn React a little bit, I'm going to make a fake little student portal applet thing. 

# Plan
- grades
    - if an assignment is clicked, there should open up a dropdown w/ deets
    - a rubric beneath which shows the divisions of the letter grades
- flashcards
    - there should be a bar on the left to select which deck
    - on the right it should show the current cards
    - with a button on the top to study
    - each card should show the front and back
    - and have a checkbox to be included
    - when you click to study, it will have side to side arrows
    - and clicking on the card will swap the side
- assignments
    - I don't even know... stuf maybe?
- lessons
    - this also should have a side bar on the left
    - the lessons should just be a page with 
    - special fields
    - or pictures
    - and subheadings
    - the sidebar should have a little dropdown for the current lesson
    - with hyperlinks that scroll down to the subheading/image of choice
